Mc-Technical is a tool that I am using to create minecraft functions and commands blocks area.
This tool was only designed for Minecraft Bedrock, it does not support Minecraft Java functions.

For now, it is only a <b>console application</b>, but I am thinking making a GUI on top of it in a near future.

It is developped on <b>Qt5</b> in c++.

It supports : Quest creation, Cutscenes, variables storage and modifications, delayed commands, ticking commands and more..

# How to use it

### How to create a sample project :
Drag and drop the folder where you want to create a sample project into the .exe, or use the command line argument :
`Mc-Technical.exe <path of your folder>`.
